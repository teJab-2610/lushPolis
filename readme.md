# [LushPolis](https://github.com/teJab-2610/lushPolis/tree/master)

LushPolis is a one-stop platform for all gardeners, from hobbyists to professionals, the website has something for everyone. In a world where humans are getting more and more detached from nature, we hope this will motivate more people to start gardening.

The project was born out of the teamâ€™s dedication to propose a solution to the SDGs' climate action. We wanted to make a web app which would enable users to connect more with nature in a positive manner.

The team consists of Teja Battula, Chetan Moturi, Vidhyabhushan Mallela, ASPVM Aditya and VSKSS Narayana Rao.

This repo is the project work for the Software Engineering Course - CS302L.

## Use cases

### Release 1

| SNo.   | Use Case Name | Description | 
| ------------ | ------------- | ----------- |
| 1.       | User Login/Register| Basic Account creation|
| 2.       | Blogs | Users can read other blogs, post their views, save the post, like the post, etc|
| 3.       | Posting/Editing Blogs    | Allow users to make their own blog posts, edit them and delete them|
| 4. | Interest Groups | Allow users to form groups for people with similar interests|
| 5. | Plant Search and ID using APIs | Utilizing 3rd-party APIs to implement Plant Identification using images and a plant text search feature |
| 6. | Group Chats | Users can form group chats in which they can talk to other users |
| 7. | Plant Diary | A basic plant diary in which users can log their plants and track them | 

## Design Decisions

1. **MongoDB models**: We have made separate models/schemas for Users, Posts, Comments, Plants, etc. This will allow us greater flexibility in utilizing these models.

2. **To include Plant Chat(_release 2_) inside the Plant diary component**: This allows us to utilize the plant diary information easily for giving input to the LLM model for initializing plant chat.

3. **User Authentication**: Used JWT auth.
