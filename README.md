# [LushPolis](https://github.com/teJab-2610/lushPolis/tree/master)

LushPolis is a one-stop platform for all gardeners, from hobbyists to professionals, the website has something for everyone. In a world where humans are getting more and more detached from nature, we hope this will motivate more people to start gardening.

The project was born out of the teamâ€™s dedication to propose a solution to the SDGs' climate action. We wanted to make a web app which would enable users to connect more with nature in a positive manner.

The team consists of Teja Battula, Chetan Moturi, Vidhyabhushan Mallela, ASPVM Aditya and VSKSS Narayana Rao.

This repo is the project work for the Software Engineering Course - CS302L.
